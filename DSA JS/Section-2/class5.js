//!Intro To Big O

//? Objectives of Section

//1.need for something like Big 0 notation
//2. what is that means Big 0 ? And why we care
//3.Simplyfy BIg 0
//4. define time and space complexity
//5.Evalute the time Complexity and space complexity on different algo using Big O Notation
//6. describe what is algoritham

//Let see imagine we have  multiple implementations of the same function. how we know what is the best. thats what reall Big O meant
//its a system to genrlize the code ,compare to code with by setting context

//there is system which need for classifying code --> soem code great,some code good, some code Only ok,some code Ehhh,Some Code Awfull
// we need use Big O sign for saying it about your code performance

//? Who Cares

//Why the code Performs need its working means best no !!!.because its depending on the project context
//its imp. to have precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
//usefull to discussing trade-offs between different approaches
//when your code slows down or crashes identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our application
//less Imp : it comes up in interviews!
